            "description": "Actions with this trait tire you for their dramatic effects. Once you use an action with the exertion trait, you must rest for 10 minutes before using another exertion action. If you are not fatigued, you can use an exertion action when you need to rest, but doing so causes you to become fatigued until you rest for 10 minutes. Some feats or actions may have an additional effect designated as “Exert”; this means you can gain those described benefits by adding the exertion trait to the action."
